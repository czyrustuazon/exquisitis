# Exquisitis
This is a basic image gallery that uses jQuery and Javascript to fetch data from a backend API. This is a fork of one of my private repos that I modified for the purposes of building my portfolio.

## Setup
Rename the config.js.example file to config.js and edit the API_DOMAIN variable to point to where the Empyrean API is located at.
